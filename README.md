# battleship
A game of battleship

The idea for this project was originally generated from the book "Head First JavaScript Programming"
    Within the first two pages of the project explanation, I decided to put down the book so I could generate my own 
    requirements and coding solutions.  This has proven thus far to be a more compelling learning practice for me
    at this point, so the shift has been a success.  I plan to build out the project just to the point that the actual
    game itself is fun to use.
