<!-- The idea for this project was originally generated from the book "Head First JavaScript Programming"
    Within the first two pages of the project explanation, I decided to put down the book so I could generate my own 
    requirements and coding solutions.  This has proven thus far to be a more compelling learning practice for me
    at this point, so the shift has been a success.  I plan to build out the project just to the point that the actual
    game itself is fun to use.  I may garner some feedback from older daughter at points along the way.

    -- PHASE 1 --
    DONE Step 1: Insert a table with one row and five columns
    DONE Step 2: Create a javascript array representing where the ship is
    DONE Step 3: Style the table such that it has three states --- unknown, empty, and full use simple color or shape
    DONE Step 4: Allow user to click a cell to reveal it's true nature
    DONE a. click-action triggers a function. Function determines the value corresponding to the clicked cell
    REMOVED b. missed functionality: add a letter "?" into each cell
    DONE c. give each cell an ID based on it's order so you can use it to correspond to the array
    DONE d. log all actions to the javascript so that I can determine when the player has won or lost.
    DONE Step 5: When all of the ship is revealed, alert the user that they have sunk the battleship
    REMOVED Step 6: Allow only a certain number of misses and game is over
    DONE Step 6.2: Alert user when all ships have been sunk and game is over.
    Step 7: For added complexity - you can add more rows
        DONE a. To allow for more complex game play you may want to update your data models a bit as follows
                DONE i. create an array just for the position of ships, defined by ranges on the grid
                DONE ii. keep existing array just for the placement everything on the grid (extending what you have)
                REMOVED iii. a separate array just for the player's click choices
    Step 8: For added fanciness - you can make the styling a little more smooth so it really look polished like a game you want to play.
    NEXT Step 9: For added gameplay complexity - create more than one hard-coded grid and randomly select from them.
    This one looks like it is going to take some serious refactoring.
    Step 10: For even more gameplay complexity - create random generation of battleships onto the grid instead of using prefabricated grids
    Step 10.5: For added gameplay complexity - make grids that have ships sitting vertically, and diagonally
    DONE Step 11: Update CSS for sunken battleship to show that it is totally sunk

    -- PHASE 2 --
    Abandoning the above steps and not creating new ones based on a new vision, which is to mimic the game Hasbro advertises
    Gameplay as follows:
    HIGH LEVEL - CREATE THE GAME BEGINNING TO END AS CLOSE TO THE REAL THING AS YOU CAN WITHOUT LOSING INTEREST
    I. Start the game: 
        1. Grid is 10 x 10 Numbers and Letters
        2. Total fleet is: Carrier - 5 Holes, Battleship - 4 Holes, Cruiser - 3 Holes, Submarine - 3 Holes, Destroyer - 2 Holes
        3. The computer grid side is set by the system
        4. The user's grid is set by themselves (Drag / drop functionality - or just click the grid and then specify the positioning (up/down or left/right))
